FileTransfer Specification, Version 1.0

1. Introduction

FileTransfer is a Windows terminal application that allows the user to create multiple file pipelines between a
remote SSH server and their local machine using OpenSSH via the SCP command.

2. Settings

The settings configuration for the FileTransfer program is saved in %APPDATA%/FileTransfer/settings.cfg, and
serves as a placeholder for the OpenSSH SCP command arguments, except "source".

2.1 Settings Arguments

a. cipher: string - Specify the cipher for encrypting the data transfer

b. ssh_config: string - Designate a subsitute per-user SSH configuration file
                        (i.e., define it as the "ssh_config" variable).

c. identity_file: string - If applicable, include this option and set the "identity_file"
                           variable as the complete path to, and the file name of th
                           private SSH key file.

d. limit: unsigned integer - The highest amount of data that can be transfered in kilobytes
                             per second (default: 1 KB/s).

e. ssh_option: string - Send the specified "ssh_option" to SSH in the ssh_config format.
                        Available options include the following (Detailed information
                        on each of these options can be found at 
                        http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config).

f. port: unsigned short: Connect to port on the remote host (default: 22) (range: 22-65535)

g. program: string - Specify the program to use for connection (probably irrelevant).

h: source: string - URL to SSH server (ex. mmiyamoto@mysshserver.com).

3. Pipelines



settings.cfg

The program settings configuration has eight options:
cipher -> a string
ssh_config -> a string
identity_file -> a string
limit -> a positive integer (default: 1000)
ssh_option -> a string
port -> a positive unsigned short (22-65535) (default: 22)
program -> a string
source -> a string (server url: i.e. user@sshserver.com)

pipelines

Every individual pipeline has a dedicated .cfg within
the pipelines directory in %appdata%/FileTransfer/
The name of the file is the ID of the pipeline, which
has a limit of 28 characters, 4 being reserved for .cfg.

<pipelineId>.cfg:
remote -> a string, directory of file in remote server
local -> a string, directory of file on machine
